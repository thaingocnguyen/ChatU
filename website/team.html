                                Salutations! I'm a 2nd year Engineering
                                Science student from SFU. People describe me
                                as "a nice dude". I think they're right. My
                                day starts with reading up about Canadian
                                politics and then transitions to some intense
                                firmware development at Sierra Wireless. I am
                                intrigued by the possibilities tech offers in
                                making the world a better place and passionate
                                about working on meaningful projects. Reach me

                                Hi! I'm a 2nd Computer Science student
                                from UBC. My favourite language to code with
                                is C++, especially in VS Code. Other languages
                                I use are C, java, bracket, and python. Part
                                of my daily routine includes neopets, studying
                                hard, and drinking lots of water. I like keeping
                                it short and sweet so I'm gonna end it there. If
                                you wanna reach me then just follow the links
                                below!

                        Hey there! I'm a 2nd year Engineering Science
                        student from SFU. My skills mainly lie in circuits,
                        design, and eating a ridiculous amount of food.
                        Languages I often use are C, C++, VHDL, VBA, HTML,
                        and Python. I am currently on co-op at Ballard Power
                        Systems in their Research team.l On my spare time I
                        enjoy building things with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
                        If you're looking for someone who is passionate about
                        the environment, health, and technology then shoot me
                        a message!
