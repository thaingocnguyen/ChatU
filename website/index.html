                    <p>
                        We're empowering students to find what they need, when 
                        they need it.

                        Finding objects like microwaves, free study spaces, and 
                        power outlets can be difficult on campus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Students at Simon Fraser University have created an entire 
                        spreadsheet dedicated to where microwaves on campus are 
                        located. Someone asked in the nwHacks2019 slack group 
                        "is there a microwave in this building?" Friends have
                        driven to campus to study, only to find that there are no 
                        study spaces available. And many of us have watched our phone 
                        battery die as we searched for a power outlet to no avail.

                        chat U is a Facebook messenger chat bot that allows 
                        students to find microwaves, study spaces, and power outlets. 
                        Utilizing crowd sourced data to find new locations of these 
                        objects allows chat U to continue to grow and learn.
