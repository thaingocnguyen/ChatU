        <pre> Hello! I’m a User Experience
          designer from UW Seattle. Currently,
          I am a senior double majoring in Human
          Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE),
          and Interdisciplinary Visual Arts (IVA). A
          mouthful, I know. HCDE is centered around
          learning user research, user experience
          design and interaction design, while IVA is
          focused on the fine arts like drawing,
          printmaking, and painting. I am graduating
          in June 2019. Some of my interests are
          accessibility,designing for kids, and gaming.
          If you have any question, comments, conundrums,
          or quibbles, feel free to contact me!</pre>

        <pre>Salutations! I’m a 2nd year Engineering
          Science student from SFU. People describe me
          as “a nice dude”. I think they’re right. My
          day starts with reading up about Canadian
          politics and then transitions to some intense
          firmware development at Sierra Wireless. I am
          intrigued by the possibilities tech offers in
          making the world a better place and passionate
          about working on meaningful projects. Reach me
          on any of the links below! </pre>

        <pre>Hi! I’m a 2nd Computer Science student
          from UBC. My favourite language to code with
          is C++, especially in VS Code. Other languages
          I use are C, java, bracket, and python. Part
          of my daily routine includes neopets, studying
          hard, and drinking lots of water. I like keeping
          it short and sweet so I’m gonna end it there. If
          you wanna reach me then just follow the links
          below!</pre>

        <pre>Hey there! I’m a 2nd year Engineering Science
          student from SFU. My skills mainly lie in circuits,
          design, and eating a ridiculous amount of food.
          Languages I often use are C, C++, VHDL, VBA, HTML,
          and Python. I am currently on co-op at Ballard Power
          Systems in their Research team.l On my spare time I
          enjoy building things with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
          If you’re looking for someone who is passionate about
          the environment, health, and technology then shoot me
          a message!
